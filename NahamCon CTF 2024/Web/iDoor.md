## Challenge 🧩

It's Apple's latest innovation, the "iDoor!" ... well, it is basically the Ring Doorbell camera, but the iDoor offers a web-based browser to monitor your camera, and super secure using ultimate cryptography with even SHA256 hashing algorithms to protect customers! Don't even think about snooping on other people's cameras!!

## Solution 🕵️‍♂️

Simple IDOR, the Customer ID is SHA256 of the number.

SHA256 of `11` Customer ID is

So SHA256 of `0` is

```bash
┌──(user㉿shell)-[~]
└─$ echo -n 0 | sha256sum
