```

Extracting the files

```bash
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(user„âøshell)-[~]
‚îî‚îÄ$ binwalk -e thebox
```

After analyzing the contents of `4981` archive we get `thebox.py` file.

After selecting only necessary lines of code, we get the flag.

```py
import hashlib

FLAG_PREFIX = "flag{%s}"

print(FLAG_PREFIX % hashlib.blake2b(('1234' + "nahamcon").encode("utf-8")).hexdigest()[:32])
```

## Flag üö©

`flag{da0a0a25f5b35fbf99e3351997bfc4c8}`
