## Challenge 🧩

Ok, you seem to have found the flag... but have you tried writing the flag back to ctl?

## Solution 🕵️‍♂️

After writing previous flag to ctl we get a [C Program](<src/C1.c>), analyzing it reveals that it writes unicode characters 0x25a0(Black Square/U+25A0) and 0x25a1(White Square/U+25A1) in a pattern to file.

After rewriting C program in [Python](<src/C1.py>) we can see the flag in ASCII art

[Flag](<src/C1_Flag.txt>)
