## Challenge 🧩

This one is not exactly caeser but it might be the key

## Solution 🕵️‍♂️

Since it not Caesar Cipher Lets try with other substitution cipher Vigenère Cipher

The Vigenère Cipher is a poly-alphabetic substitution cipher that uses a keyword as the key to encrypt and decrypt messages. Each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a corresponding letter in the keyword, cycling through the keyword as needed.

In this scenario, we will decrypt this cipher using **caeser** as the key.

After Decrypting

```text
The Vigenere cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher.
It is a more sophisticated version of the Caesar cipher, which uses a single shift value to encrypt the entire message.
