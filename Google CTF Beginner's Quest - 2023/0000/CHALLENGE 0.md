## Challenge 🧩

Let's test your knowledge on Caesar's methods.

## Solution 🕵️‍♂️

Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher. It shifts each letter in the plaintext by a certain number of positions down or up the alphabet.

### Determining the Shift

`SYNT{.....}` </br>
`FLAG{.....}`

In this case, we have a 13-shift encryption(ROT-13). So, we need to shift each letter 13 positions down the alphabet.

After Decrypting

Anyway, Caesar was a skilled communicator, and he used a variety of methods to keep his messages secret from his enemies.
One of these methods was the Caesar cipher, a simple technique to obfuscate communications.
FLAG{rotate_that_alphabet}
